- PROJECT : PROG2121 - Assignment #05 - Server Side
- PROGRAMMER : Sky Roth
- FIRST VERSION : November 4, 2020
- LAST UPDATE   : November 9, 2020
- DESCRIPTION : This program will act as the server for the client chat programs, it will create a new server and handle the clients
-                   that connect to it. When new messages are sent, the server will read it and send it to the other connected clients
